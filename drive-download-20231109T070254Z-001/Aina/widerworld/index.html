<h1>About us</h1>
<h2>Get to know our story</h2>
<div class="container">
<div class="text"><p>To talk about WiderWorld's beggining, we have to go all the way back into 1990, when our now CEO Rocío Cejudo travelled to Ibiza and was astonished by everything the city had to offer. This awakened her apetite for adventure and her desire to know the world, and marked the birth of "El Mon de Rocío", a comprehensive travel agency organizing trips and accomodation across Europe.</p></div>

</div>
<p>The company kept expanding over time, adding new employes, offices and destinations almost every month, so it was not a surprise when "El Mon de Rocío" had already seen it everything, growing the need to explore even more places. The question was, where?

    This marked the rebranding and rebirth of her company into "WiderWorld", conquering places only few were lucky enough to be in.
    
    Our first partnership began with Viajes El Corte Inglés, and resulting in the first ever holiday provider to offer a Moon Landing One-Day Retreat, with innovative activities like Zero Gravity Cardio™️.
    
    Thanks to the experience aquired, it was not long before our first Mars Launch took place, this time being able to spend up to three days in one of our Controlled Atmosphere Dome™️, and unique day activities such as Sing Happy Birthday to Curiosity™️.
    
    As a result of our active colaboration with NASA and the Spanish Space Program, WiderWorld has succesfully launched the first manned mission to Jupiter, new destination to be added to our line-up starting Q3 2024 broadening our catalogue of unique experiences even more with new adventures only for the bold ones.
